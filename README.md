# Uniqodo test

##Problem #1
Using diagrams only, design the code Validation API architecture showcasing the core
components only .i.e. the flow of logic from the controller to concrete models- the MVC
structure. Exclude the database and other infrastructure details (e.g. web servers, routing,
frameworks code e.t.c) from your design.

Class diagrams (including method names) and a sketch of how different parts of the
application interact will suffice. No codes required for this part.

##Solution for problem #1   



#Problem 2
Below is a set of standard rules, just to mention a few, for a code to be valid:
- Code exists in the system
- Code status is active
- The code is in date
- The code being checked by a client belongs to the client account
- Has not exceeded its usage allowance

Please note thatthis is notthe full list of rules.

Please provide some codes for your classes here including methods necessary for validating a
promotional code against the rules. You don’t have to show the complete code for the methods
just as long as they show intentions with classes and methods. Also, you can ignore other parts
of the architecture like database queries here.

#Problem 3
Uniqodo would like to be notified about any unhandled exception that occurs in the API. What
solution would you put in place in order to achieve this? A simple explanation will suffice here.
